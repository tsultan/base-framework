3. Use `git add README.md` to stage this change in your local environment
3. Make a new branch and switch to it using checkout. For example, my branch I named Ivan_W so I ran `git checkout -b Ivan_W` where the -b tag specifies new branch. 
4. Use the --set-upstream tag with git push to set which branch your `git push` pushes to. For my branch I ran `git push --set-upstream origin Ivan_W`
5. `git commit` your local changes to your branch in the repo
6. `git push` these changes onto server
7. Create a pull request to merge your branch with the master branch. This can be done by accessign GitHub via browser or with `git request-pull` (GitHub via browser is much easier)
